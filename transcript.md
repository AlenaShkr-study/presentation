  Hi. My name is Alena.  
  
  And It’s the presentation on the topic “Typescript” for task “presentation” of Rolling Scope School.  
We will start and, of course, we start from short historical information.  
Typescript was developed in 2012 at Microsoft. The most publicly recognizable name behind TypeScript is  Anders Hejlsberg (designer of C#). 

Typescript is a language, but compare to Javascript it’s a strongly typed, object oriented, compiled language.
TypeScript is just JavaScript. TypeScript starts with JavaScript and ends with JavaScript. It contains all of Javascript elements.
All TypeScript code is converted into its JavaScript equivalent for the purpose of execution
So TypeScript is both a language and a set of tools or as called a typed superset of JavaScript. In other words, TypeScript is JavaScript
plus some additional features.  

So, TypeScript has the following three components: language,The TypeScript Compiler,The TypeScript Language Service.
Language comprises of the syntax, keywords, and type annotations. 
 The TypeScript compiler (tsc) is that converts the instructions written in TypeScript to its JavaScript equivalent. 
 The "Language Service" exposes an additional layer around the core compiler pipeline that are editor-like applications.   
 The language service supports the common set of a typical editor operations like statement completions,  code formatting and etc.  

Features of Typescript. Typescript supports Object Oriented Programming concepts, Typescript supports compilation and 
 supports strong typing.
 TypeScript-generated JavaScript can reuse all of the existing JavaScript frameworks, tools, and libraries.So Typescript supports other JS libraries and supports type definitions.  
 Typescript is a superset of ES6, so all feature of ES6 are there plus some additional features. So Typescript support ES6 features.  

TypeScript supports Object Oriented Programming concepts like classes, interfaces, inheritance, etc. These OOP features make TypeScript code cleaner and more organized. On slide show some examples this concepts.
Interfaces are a good way of specifying a contract. Generics help to provide compile-time checking, inheritance enables new objects to take on the properties of existing objects, and access modifiers control the accessibility of the members of a class.
TypeScript has two access modifiers — public and private. By default, the members are public.  

The TypeScript transpiler provides the error-checking feature. TypeScript will compile the code and generate compilation errors, if it finds some sort of syntax errors. 
This helps to highlight errors before the script is run.  

TypeScript does not allow intermixing of values with different datatypes. When such restrictions are violated, errors are thrown. Therefore,Types are  had to define when declaring variables and you cannot assign other values other than the type defined which is very possible in JavaScript.
The syntax to assign a type to any variable is to write the name of the variable followed by a : sign, and then the name of the type followed by a =equally sign and the value of the variable.
The any data type is the superset of all the data types in TypeScript. Giving any variable the type of any is equivalent to opting out of type checking for a variable.   

Thank for typing,compilation and OOP featers Typescript can be used for both, client-side as well as server-side development. 

Before starting coding,  need to install TypeScript on computer.
There are two main ways to get the TypeScript tools: 
-	Via npm (the Node.js package manager) by command;  
-	By installing TypeScript’s Visual Studio plugins.

And in the end, of course, need share
useful Links on TypeScript: the first, it's
TypeScript Official Website with official documentation and  the seecond Typescript online console, where you can look at how Typescript code convert to Javascript code.

Thanks for your attention.
